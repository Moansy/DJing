<h1><center>Pioneer</center></h1>
<p><center>Pioneer is the leading DJ brand for equipment and has been proven to be the most reliable in all types of scenarios.</center></p>

<h1><center>CDJs</center></h1>
<p><center>CDJs are now these much more frequently used ahead of turntables, CDJs are essentially what the music is played from,</center></p>
<p><center>and as you might have noticed DJs are often provided with at least 2 CDJs, with most big music festivals supplying them with 4 CDJs.</center></p>
<p><center>These pieces of equipment are used to switch between songs so there is no stop in between playing as well as beatmatching songs together to help them blend.</center></p>

<div>
<h1><center>Mixers</center></h1>
<p><center>A DJ will only ever need 1 mixer as the centre piece of his set up with a CDJ either side of the mixer, its job is help mix beats from the CDJs</center></p>
<p><center>together as well as cross fading between each CDJ to keep the music playing without that stop start feel for listeners. It contains multiple knobs </center></p>
<p><center>to dictate frequencies and what is known as an EQs section to add effects and background sounds to the music, as well as faders to change tempo and songs.</center></p>

<div>
<h1><center>Software</center></h1>
<p><center>Software often depends on the specific hardware equipment as well as what is provided to be played with. Most DJs must be able to adapt</center></p>
<p><center>when it comes to software as there are multiple types of software used and not all are compatible on certain hardware. The main softwares are</center></p>
<p><center>Rekordbox, Serato and Traktor, with Ableton used as the software for DJs to create their own original sounds.</center></p>

<div>
<h1><center>Assentials</center></h1>
<p><center>Headphones, USB sticks and a Laptop are all small but yet important pieces of equipment needed to DJ. Headphones are used to prepare the next song</center></p>
<p><center>and make sure it matches the bpm and mixes well with the current song playing. USB sticks hold the DJs personal songs and playlists,</center></p>
<p><center>without them their is no music. A Laptop might not always need to be used as CDJs have a built in software but the option is there if needed</center></p>
